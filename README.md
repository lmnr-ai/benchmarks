# OpenHands Benchmarks

This repository contains benchmark evaluation infrastructure for [OpenHands](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/) agents. It provides standardized evaluation pipelines for testing agent capabilities across various real-world tasks.

⚠️ **Migration in Progress**: We are currently migrating the [benchmarks from OpenHands V0](https://github.com/OpenHands/OpenHands/tree/main/evaluation) to work with the [OpenHands Software Agent SDK](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk) infrastructure in V1.

## Available Benchmarks

| Benchmark | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| [SWE-Bench](benchmarks/swebench/) | Software engineering tasks from GitHub issues | ✅ Active |
| [GAIA](benchmarks/gaia/) | General AI assistant tasks requiring multi-step reasoning | ✅ Active |
| [Commit0](benchmarks/commit0/) | Python function implementation tasks with unit tests | ✅ Active |
| [OpenAgentSafety](benchmarks/openagentsafety/) | AI agent safety evaluation in workplace scenarios with NPC interactions | ✅ Active |

See the individual benchmark directories for detailed usage instructions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before running any benchmarks, you need to set up the environment and ensure the local Agent SDK submodule is initialized.

```bash
make build
```

### 🧩 1. Initialize the Agent SDK submodule

The Benchmarks project uses a **local git submodule** for the [OpenHands Agent SDK](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk).
This ensures your code runs against a specific, reproducible commit.

Run once after cloning (already done in `make build` for you):

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This command will:
- clone the SDK into `vendor/software-agent-sdk/`
- check out the exact commit pinned by this repo
- make it available for local development (`uv sync` will install from the local folder)

If you ever clone this repository again, remember to re-initialize the submodule with the same command.

---

### 🏗️ 2. Build the environment

Once the submodule is set up, install dependencies via [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv):

```bash
make build
```

This runs:

```bash
uv sync
```

and ensures the `openhands-*` packages (SDK, tools, workspace, agent-server) are installed **from the local workspace** declared in `pyproject.toml`.

---

### 🔄 3. Update the submodule (when SDK changes)

If you want to update to a newer version of the SDK:

```bash
cd vendor/software-agent-sdk
git fetch
git checkout <new_commit_or_branch>
cd ../..
git add vendor/software-agent-sdk
git commit -m "Update software-agent-sdk submodule to <new_commit_sha>"
```

Then re-run:

```bash
make build
```

to rebuild your environment with the new SDK code.

</details>

### Configure Your LLM

All benchmarks require an LLM configuration file. Define your LLM config as a JSON following the model fields in the [LLM class](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/blob/main/openhands/sdk/llm/llm.py#L93).

**Example** (`.llm_config/example.json`):

```json
{
  "model": "litellm_proxy/anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "base_url": "https://llm-proxy.eval.all-hands.dev",
  "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

Validate your configuration:

```bash
uv run validate-cfg .llm_config/YOUR_CONFIG_PATH.json
```

## Running Benchmarks

After setting up the environment and configuring your LLM, see the individual benchmark directories for specific usage instructions:

- **[SWE-Bench](benchmarks/swebench/)**: Software engineering tasks from GitHub issues
- **[GAIA](benchmarks/gaia/)**: General AI assistant tasks requiring multi-step reasoning  
- **[OpenAgentSafety](benchmarks/openagentsafety/)**: AI agent safety evaluation in workplace scenarios with NPC interactions

## Workspace Types

Benchmarks support two workspace types for running evaluations:

### Docker Workspace (Default)

Uses local Docker containers to run agent evaluations. Images are built locally on-demand.

- **Pros**: No additional setup required, works offline
- **Cons**: Resource-intensive on local machine, slower for large-scale evaluations
- **Use case**: Development, testing, small-scale evaluations

### Remote Workspace

Uses a [remote runtime API](https://openhands.dev/blog/evaluation-of-llms-as-coding-agents-on-swe-bench-at-30x-speed) to provision containers in a cloud environment, enabling massive parallelization.

- **Pros**: Scalable to hundreds of parallel workers, no local resource constraints
- **Cons**: Requires pre-built images and API access
- **Use case**: Large-scale evaluations, benchmarking runs

#### How Remote Runtime Works

1. **Pre-build Agent Images**: Agent-server images must be pre-built for a specific SDK commit (SHA) and pushed to a public container registry (e.g., `ghcr.io/openhands/eval-agent-server`)
   
2. **Runtime API**: The remote workspace connects to a runtime API service (default: `https://runtime.eval.all-hands.dev`) that provisions containers on-demand

3. **Image Resolution**: Before starting evaluation, the system verifies that the required image exists in the registry with the correct tag format: `{IMAGE}:{SDK_SHA}-{CUSTOM_TAG}{SUFFIX}`

4. **Parallel Execution**: Each evaluation instance runs in its own isolated container, allowing for massive parallelization (e.g., 32+ concurrent workers)

#### Prerequisites for Remote Workspace

1. **Pre-built Images**: Images must be built and pushed to a public registry
   - In this repository, add one of the following labels to a PR to trigger image builds:
     - `build-swebench-50`: Build 50 images (quick testing)
     - `build-swebench-200`: Build 200 images (medium testing)
     - `build-swebench`: Build all images (full evaluation)
   - Images are tagged with the SDK SHA from the `vendor/software-agent-sdk` submodule

2. **Runtime API Key**: Set the `RUNTIME_API_KEY` environment variable
   ```bash
   export RUNTIME_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

3. **Optional Configuration**:
   - `RUNTIME_API_URL`: Override the default API endpoint (default: `https://runtime.eval.all-hands.dev`)
   - `SDK_SHORT_SHA`: Override the SDK SHA for image selection (default: auto-detected from submodule)

See individual benchmark READMEs for specific usage examples.

## SDK Compatibility and Version Management

⚠️ **Important**: The benchmarks repository depends on the [OpenHands Agent SDK](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk), and **not every version of the benchmarks is compatible with every version of the SDK**. As the SDK evolves and introduces new features, the benchmarks code may adopt these features, creating version dependencies.

### SWE-Bench image layering (docutils/roman)

Some SWE-Bench instances (notably `sphinx-doc`) require `docutils<0.21` and `roman`. The build pipeline now wraps only those images that need the extra layer:
- `benchmarks/swebench/build_images.py` wraps images for repos in a small allowlist (currently `sphinx-doc`).
- Other repos (e.g., scikit-learn) keep the base image unchanged.
- Wrapped images reuse the same tag (no suffix) since they're evaluation-only.

When running or dispatching builds, no extra flags are needed—the selective wrapping is handled for you.

### Evaluating Different SDK Versions

When evaluating a specific SDK version, you need to ensure the benchmarks code is compatible with that SDK version. You have two options:

1. **Use the `benchmarks-commit` parameter in the workflow** (Recommended):
   - When manually triggering the `build-swe-bench-images` workflow (builds + wraps images in-place), specify both:
     - `sdk-commit`: The SDK version you want to evaluate
     - `benchmarks-commit`: A benchmarks commit that's compatible with that SDK version
   
2. **Manually check out compatible versions locally**:
   ```bash
   # Check out a benchmarks commit that's compatible with your target SDK version
   git checkout <benchmarks-commit>
   
   # Update the SDK submodule to your target version
   cd vendor/software-agent-sdk
   git checkout <sdk-commit>
   cd ../..
   
   # Rebuild the environment
   make build
   ```

### Example: SDK Critic Module

A notable example of version dependency is the SDK critic module. As of SDK commit [`79868ae5`](https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/commit/79868ae5) (November 17, 2025), the OpenHands Agent SDK introduced the `openhands.sdk.critic` module. Current benchmarks code imports `CriticBase` from this module, which means:

- **SDK versions ≥ `79868ae5`**: Compatible with current benchmarks code
- **SDK versions < `79868ae5`**: Require an older benchmarks commit (before the critic import was added)

To check if a specific benchmarks commit requires the critic module:
```bash
git show <commit>:benchmarks/utils/models.py | grep "from openhands.sdk.critic"
```

If this command returns output, that benchmarks commit requires an SDK version with the critic module.
